      <h1>Welcome to Alambic II Tool!</h1>
      <p>This is a tool for evaluating temporal formulas, based on a set of specified boolean
         signals. These formulas are a straight-forward way to illustrate what can sometimes become
         very complicated processing in systems with temporal logic. The features of this app are:</p>

      <h2>Boolean signals</h2>

      <h3>Symbols</h3>

      <p>Below is the notation used to define boolean signal:</p>
      <table>
         <tr>
            <td>Equal sign &#40;{{symbols.equal}}&#41;:</td>
            <td>used to associate a boolean signal to its identifier</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>Slash &#40;{{symbols.slash}}&#41;:</td>
            <td>used to determine the periodic part of a signal</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>Semi-colon &#40;{{symbols.semiColon}}&#41;:</td>
            <td>used to separated multiple boolean signals</td>
         </tr>
      </table>

      <p>Boolean signals must follow a strict syntax: id1 = fixedPart1/periodicPart1[;id2 =
         fixedPart2/periodicPart2...]</p>

      <h3>Parts of a boolean signal</h3>

      <p>Each boolean signal is composed of three basic parts</p>
      <dl>
         <dt>identifiers</dt>
         <dd>identifiers match an exact string of text in lower case and must be unique. e.g.
            a, b, mysignal, etc.</dd>

         <dt>fixed part of a signal</dt>
         <dd>every signal has a fixed part composed of 1s and 0s. e.g. 1011, 101, etc.</dd>

         <dt>periodic part of a signal</dt>
         <dd>every signal has an endlessly repeated part composed of 1s and 0s and preceded by
            a slash. e.g. /01, /011, etc.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
         So a boolean signal can be represented such as: a = 1001/11. One can provide multiple
         boolean signals separated by semi-colons.
         <br />
         For example: a = 1001/11;b = 101/10.
         <br />
      </p>

      <p>A boolean signal can be altered by clicking on it in the list under the main text
         field. Once a modification has occurred, its chart is updated and also the charts of all of
         the formulas referencing it</p>

      <h2>Temporal formulas</h2>

      <h3>Symbols &amp; operators</h3>

      <p>Below is the notation used to define logical and temporal operators:</p>
      <table class="operatorsTable">
         <tr>
            <td>
               logical AND &#40;
               <span ng-bind-html='symbols.prettyAnd'></span>
               &#41;:
            </td>
            <td>&amp;</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>
               logical OR &#40;
               <span ng-bind-html='symbols.prettyOr'></span>
               &#41;:
            </td>
            <td>&#124;</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>
               NOT &#40;
               <span ng-bind-html='symbols.prettyNot'></span>
               &#41;:
            </td>
            <td>&#33;</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>
               EVENTUALLY &#40;
               <span ng-bind-html='symbols.prettyEventually'></span>
               &#41;:
            </td>
            <td>&lt;&gt;</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>
               ALWAYS &#40;
               <span ng-bind-html='symbols.prettyAlways'></span>
               &#41;:
            </td>
            <td>&#91;&#93;</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>WEAK UNTIL &#40;W&#41;:</td>
            <td>W</td>
         </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Operator precedence</h3>

      <p>Below is the order in which logical and temporal operators are evaluated:</p>

      <ol>
         <li>PARENTHESES &#40;&#41;</li>
         <li>
            NOT
            <span ng-bind-html='symbols.prettyNot'></span>
         </li>
         <li>
            EVENTUALLY
            <span ng-bind-html='symbols.prettyEventually'></span>
         </li>
         <li>
            ALWAYS
            <span ng-bind-html='symbols.prettyAlways'></span>
         </li>
         <li>WEAK UNTIL W</li>
         <li>
            AND
            <span ng-bind-html='symbols.prettyAnd'></span>
         </li>
         <li>
            OR
            <span ng-bind-html='symbols.prettyOr'></span>
         </li>
      </ol>


      <h3>Temporal formulas</h3>
      <p>Temporal formulas reference existing boolean signals such as a&#44;b&#44; etc. For
         example&#44; the temporal formula f {{symbols.equal}} a W b references the signals a and b.
         Thus, these two signals cannot be deleted as long as they are referenced.</p>
      <p>the relationship between temporal formulas and booleans signals is of type
         many-to-many. That means, each boolean signal can be referenced by zero or many temporal
         formulas, and a temporal formula can reference one or many boolean signals.</p>

      <p>Temporal formulas can also be altered by clicking on them in the list below the main
         text field.</p>



      <h2>Graphical presentation</h2>

      <p>Both boolean signals and temporal formulas are presented by a boolean chart.</p>
